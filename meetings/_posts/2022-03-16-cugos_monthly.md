**Russell Mercer** will join us to talk about building an enterprise GIS at a small city using FOSS4G technologies. Russell is the GIS Coordinator of GIS department of the City of Imperial Beach in California.

**Martin Davis** will be talking about two services that make it easy to access PostGIS data from web clients: [pg_featureserv](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_featureserv) and [pg_tileserv](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_tileserv).  He might also talk about GEOS and JTS if there's interest in geometry things.
